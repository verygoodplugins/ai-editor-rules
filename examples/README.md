## 🔍 How to Use These Examples

### 1. Study the Patterns

Look at how rules are implemented in real projects:

```bash
# Compare rule implementations
diff examples/wp-fusion/.cursor/rules/core.mdc rules/wordpress/.cursor/rules/core.mdc

# Study project-specific adaptations
cat examples/echodash-mvp/insights/lessons-learned.md
```

### 2. Adapt for Your Project

Take successful patterns and adapt them:

1. **Copy relevant rule sections** that apply to your use case
2. **Modify naming conventions** to match your project
3. **Add domain-specific patterns** based on the examples
4. **Test incrementally** as shown in the example workflows

### 3. Learn from Gotchas

Read the `insights/gotchas.md` files to avoid common pitfalls:

- Rule conflicts that caused issues
- Performance problems from overly complex rules
- Team adoption challenges and solutions
- Integration issues with existing codebases

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

Use these examples to validate your own rules:

### Comparison Testing
```bash
# Generate similar code with your rules
# Compare output quality with examples
# Measure development speed improvements
```

### Quality Checks
- Does generated code match the quality in examples?
- Are security patterns properly implemented?
- Do performance optimizations get applied?
- Is the code style consistent with examples?
