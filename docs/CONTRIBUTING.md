# Contributing to AI Editor Rules

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you add your own rules, improve existing ones, and collaborate effectively.

## üéØ Types of Contributions

### 1. New Rule Sets
- Technology-specific rules (new languages, frameworks)
- Workflow-specific rules (CI/CD, testing, documentation)
- Industry-specific patterns (e-commerce, healthcare, fintech)

### 2. Improvements to Existing Rules
- Bug fixes in rule logic
- Performance optimizations
- Better documentation and examples
- Additional prompts and slash commands

### 3. Real-World Examples
- Share how you've implemented these rules in actual projects
- Before/after comparisons showing rule effectiveness
- Case studies and lessons learned

## üìã Contribution Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Contribution Type

#### For New Rule Sets:
1. Check if similar rules already exist in the repository
2. Create an issue proposing your new rule set
3. Wait for feedback before starting implementation

#### For Improvements:
1. Open an issue describing the problem or enhancement
2. Reference specific files and line numbers when possible
3. Provide examples of the current vs. desired behavior

### Step 2: Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-editor-rules.git
cd ai-editor-rules
git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name
```

### Step 3: Follow the Structure

#### For Technology Rules (`rules/technology-name/`)
```

### Step 4: Writing Quality Rules

#### Rule File Structure (.mdc files)
```markdown
# Rule Category Name

## Overview
Brief description of what this rule set covers and when to use it.

## Core Principles
- Principle 1: Clear, actionable guideline
- Principle 2: Another important guideline
- Principle 3: etc.

## Patterns

### Pattern Name
Description of the pattern with code examples.

```language
// Good example
const goodExample = () => {
  // Implementation
};

// Bad example to avoid
const badExample = () => {
  // What not to do
};
```

### File Organization
- Describe how files should be organized
- Include naming conventions
- Explain directory structure

## Documentation Standards
- How to document code
- Required comments and annotations
- API documentation patterns

## Error Handling
- Standard error handling patterns
- Logging conventions
- User-facing error messages

## Testing
- Testing patterns and conventions
- Mock/stub guidelines
- Test organization
```

#### CLAUDE.md Structure
```markdown
# Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
Brief description of the project type and main technologies.

## Architecture
High-level architecture description.

## Key Files and Directories
- `important/file.ext` - Description of what this file does
- `another/directory/` - What this directory contains

## Development Workflow
1. Step-by-step development process
2. Common tasks and commands
3. Quality checks and validations

## Coding Standards
Reference to the .cursor/rules files and any additional context.

## Common Patterns

```

### Step 5: Testing Your Rules

Before submitting:

1. **Test in a real project**: Apply your rules to an actual codebase
2. **Validate with AI**: Test prompts and ensure Claude responds appropriately
3. **Check for conflicts**: Ensure rules don't contradict each other
4. **Documentation review**: Make sure all examples work as shown

### Step 6: Submit Your Contribution

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add [technology/workflow] rules with examples"
git push origin feature/your-contribution-name

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```

## üìù Pull Request Guidelines
